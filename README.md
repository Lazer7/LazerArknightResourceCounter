# Lazer's Arknight Resource Counter# Lazer Arknight Resource Counter

Hi all this is the beginning of the Arknight Resource Counter that leverages from [Penguin Statistics](https://penguin-stats.io/). I am trying to create a more personalized site to show individual statistics and how much that individual has contributed to the stats to Penguin Statistics. Please report issues on the github page if you find anything wrong and thank you for using Lazer Arknight Resource Counter
